			One Week is a 2008 Canadian drama film written and directed by Michael McGowan and starring Joshua Jackson, Liane Balaban, and Campbell Scott.<br>
			 The film debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, 2008, and was released theatrically in Canada by Mongrel Media on March 6, 2009. <br>
	 
			Jackson plays Ben Tyler, who has been diagnosed with cancer. Requiring immediate treatment, he instead decides to take a motorcycle trip from Toronto <br>
			 across Canada to Vancouver Island. Along the way, he meets several people that help him reevaluate his relationship with his <br>
			 fianc√©e Samantha (played by Balaban), his job, and his dream of becoming a writer. <br>
	 
		   
			The scenic backdrop of the Canadian landscape as well as an all-Canadian soundtrack serve as prevalent influences in the film. <br>
		   
			Joshua Jackson won Best Actor at the 2010 Genie Awards for his portrayal of Ben Tyler. Liane Balaban was nominated for Best Supporting Actress.
